## Inode based file system Implementation
In this assignment, you need to build an Inode-based file system with limited
functionality.
‚óè This file system is a simplified version of a typical UNIX file system and thus
serves to introduce some of the basic on-disk structures, access methods, and
various policies that you will find in many file systems today.

#### Pre-requisites
1. C++  
2. Working of inode  
3. Working of file handling  
4. Working of system calls

#### Installation

```python
sudo apt-get install g++
```

### Compilation

```python
g++ aso4.cpp -o aos
```

#### Usage
